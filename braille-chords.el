;;; Commentary:

;; ########   Compatibility   ############################################
;;
;; Tested on Emacs 24.3.1
;;

;; ########   Quick start     ############################################
;;
;; Add to your ~/.emacs
;;     (require 'braille-chords)
;;
;; Enter Braille chords mode with:
;;     M-x braille-chords-mode
;;
;; While in Braille chords mode, simultaneous press multiple keys in
;; the home row of the keyboard.  By default, these are mapped to be
;; convenient on an English QWERTY keyboard:
;;
;;    key | f d s j k l a ;
;;    ----+----------------
;;    dot | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
;;
;;   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
;;   | q | w | e | r | t | y | u | i | o | p |
;;   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
;;     |=7=|=3=|=2=|=1=| g | h |=4=|=5=|=6=|=8=|
;;     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
;;       | z | x | c | v | b | n | m | , | . |
;;       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
;;
;; Exit Braille chords mode by pressing a printable, non-whitespace character
;; that is not one of the dot keys mentioned above.
;;

;; ########   Description     ############################################
;;
;; This package was developed using David Andersson's key-chord.el as an
;; example of how to create a small package which overrides the Emacs
;; input-mode and "detects" simultaneous key presses.
;;
;; Braille chords mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  It is controlled
;; by the function `braille-chords-mode'.
;;
;; When in Braille chords mode, simultaneous keypresses of the home key
;; are combined to create single Braille patterns.  Each finger in the
;; home position represents a dot in the overall Braille pattern.  The
;; left index finger is dot 1, the left middle finger is dot 2, and
;; the left ring finger is dot 3.  The right index finger is dot 4,
;; the right middle finger is dot 5, and the right ring finger is dot
;; 6.  The left pinky is dot 7.  The right pinky is dot 8.
;;
;; As an example, while in Braille chords mode, pressing 's', 'd', 'f',
;; and 'j' simultaneously generates the Braille pattern ⠏ which has
;; dots 1, 2, 3, and 4 set.
;;
;; You can override this mapping by setting the `braille-dot-keys'
;; association list.
;;
;; When in Braille chords mode, spaces are converted to the blank Braille
;; pattern.  All other whitespace is left as-is.
;;
;; When in Braille chords mode, pressing a printable, non-whitespace
;; character that does not represent a Braille dot exits Braille chords
;; mode.
;;
;; If chorded input is not your thing, you may like to check out
;; braille-input.el which is a contrib to the liblouis project that
;; allows one to enter Braille patterns using abbreviations for the
;; dot-patterns.  For example, the ⠕ pattern would be entered as
;; `b135' using that library.

;; ########   Limitations     ############################################
;;
;; Emacs does not provide both `key-down' and `key-up' events.  The
;; idea of "simultaneity" here is that the key-presses were received
;; in rapid succession.  You can control how many seconds between
;; consecutive presses count as "simultaneous" with the
;; `braille-dot-delay' variable.  On top of that, Emacs macros
;; effectively play back keystrokes without regard for timing, so
;; there is almost no chance that you can invoke a macro while in
;; Braille chords mode with any useful results.
;;
;; No effort has been made to ensure that your buffer is in a mode
;; which supports Unicode characters.  If it is not, then the
;; character inserted into your buffer may be illegal for the current
;; mode or not display as a Braille pattern.
;;
;; Braille chords mode overrides the `input-method-function'.  So do a
;; variety of other packages (key-chord, mule, quail, ...).  They
;; don't play well together.  If you run into trouble, I recommend
;; using Braille mode in a scratch buffer and yanking the results into
;; the buffer you want.
;;
;; Emacs will not call `input-method-function' for keys that have
;; non-numeric codes or whose code is outside the range 32..126, so
;; only keys in that range can be used to represent Braille dots or
;; to escape from Braille chords mode.
;;
;; The BRAILLE PATTERN BLANK is not recognized as whitespace by any of
;; the functions which attempt to linewrap or otherwise reformat text.
;; On the other hand, for most fonts, spaces are a different width
;; than the BRAILLE PATTERN BLANK.  You can set the
;; `braille-blank-for-space' variable to `NIL' if you would prefer to
;; have <Space>s remain <Space>s.
